# correction_controller

A ROS 2 package that performs **open-loop correction** of a drone using a provided FLU-frame `Pose`. The node applies a 3D translation and yaw rotation sequentially, using only velocity commands and no feedback. It also integrates **obstacle avoidance** via LaserScan range checking.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Receives a 6DOF correction transform (`Pose`) in FLU frame.
- Executes **open-loop linear movement** toward a given offset.
- Applies **open-loop yaw rotation** based on quaternion orientation.
- Pauses both translation and rotation if **any obstacle is within a configurable distance**.
- Accepts fully configurable topics and parameters via launch file.

---

## ðŸ§  Behavior

1. Subscribes to `Pose` correction (translation + rotation).
2. **Translates first** in original FLU direction (to preserve frame correctness).
3. After reaching target distance, **rotates to desired yaw**.
4. Stops and awaits the next correction.
5. Pauses motion if any LaserScan reading is too close.
